title: Primefaces Advanced FileUpload as Simple
---

We just discovered a new way to do file upload. We're using the Advanced mode of the p:fileUpload as the simple mode.
All we did was, removing the classes of the advanced mode, so it looks like the simple. Doing that, we have an ajax file upload.

More details soon!
