title: Primefaces Advanced FileUpload as Simple
---

We just discovered a new way to do file upload. We're using the Advanced mode of the p:fileUpload as the simple mode.
All we did was to remove the classes of the advanced mode so it looks like the simple one. By doing that, we have a fully working ajax file upload component.
