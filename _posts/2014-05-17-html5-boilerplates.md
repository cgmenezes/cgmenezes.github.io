title: Great Html5 Boilerplates
---

I already knew the Initializr boilerplate, but now I decided to discover some of its details. It's an incredible starter that you may use for your next website or blog. Another great solution is the Html5 Boilerplate, which was made by great developers and designers to help us build our projects faster, without the need of thinking about what to use. It's already built, just use it.
